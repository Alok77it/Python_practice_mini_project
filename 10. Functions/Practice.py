# üîÅ PRACTICE SET: FUNCTIONS, ARGS, KWARGS, LAMBDA, RECURSION, YIELD

# 1. Write a simple function that prints "Hello, World!".
def greet():
    print("Hello World!")
    
greet()

# 2. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.


# 3. Write a function that takes a name and age, and prints a greeting using both (multiple parameters).


# 4. Demonstrate a function that returns multiple values (like name and age as a tuple).


# 5. Write a function using *args to calculate the sum of any number of numbers.


# 6. Write a function using **kwargs to print employee details (like name, id, location).


# 7. Create a function with both *args and **kwargs, and print both inside the function.


# 8. Write a lambda function to square a number.


# 9. Write a lambda function to check if a number is even or odd.


# 10. Create a list of numbers and use `map()` with a lambda to double each number.


# 11. Write a function that demonstrates polymorphism by accepting two different types of arguments (e.g., string and list) and printing their lengths.


# 12. Write a recursive function to calculate factorial of a number.


# 13. Write a recursive function to print numbers from n to 1.


# 14. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers.


# 15. Write a recursive function to generate the nth Fibonacci number.


# 16. Create a generator function that yields numbers from 1 to 5.


# 17. Create a generator function that yields squares of numbers up to n.


# 18. Use `next()` to get values one by one from a generator.


# 19. Write a function that receives a filename and uses a generator to read the file line by line.


# 20. Compare `return` vs `yield` by writing two similar functions: one returns a list, and the other yields values one by one.


# ‚úÖ BONUS: Try combining recursion, *args, and **kwargs in one program!
