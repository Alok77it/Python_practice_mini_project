# ðŸš€ Python Exception Handling â€“ Practice Set (20 Questions)

# 1. Write a program that handles division by zero and prints a friendly message.

# 2. Write a program to open a file and handle the case where the file does not exist.

# 3. Create a list and try to access an invalid index. Handle the exception properly.

# 4. Create a loop that processes a list of strings and converts them to integers, skipping invalid entries using exception handling.

# 5. Write a program that uses `try-except-else` to check if a number is positive and divisible by another number.

# 6. Demonstrate how `finally` is used to close a file even when an exception is raised.

# 7. Make a simple program to call a REST API using `requests` and handle any `RequestException`.

# 8. Handle `ValueError` while converting user input from string to integer.

# 9. Handle `TypeError` in a function that only works with numbers.

# 10. Write a program that reads a configuration from a file. If not found, use default values.

# 11. Demonstrate multiple `except` blocks catching different exceptions in a single `try` block.

# 12. Handle `KeyError` when trying to access a key from a dictionary that may not exist.

# 13. Write a function that manually raises a `ValueError` if a given number is negative.

# 14. Create a custom exception class called `NegativeAgeError` and use it when invalid age is input.

# 15. Demonstrate exception handling in a loop that processes multiple rows of data, skipping bad rows.

# 16. Simulate an error in a system service using `subprocess` and handle the `CalledProcessError`.

# 17. Use `try-except-finally` in a database connection simulation to ensure the connection closes.

# 18. Show an example where `try-except` is used inside a function and the error is handled outside.

# 19. Raise an exception if a machine learning model's accuracy is below 50%, using a custom exception.

# 20. Simulate a retry mechanism in DevOps using a loop and exception handling for unstable network calls.

# ðŸ’¡ Bonus: After solving all, try combining 2-3 of them into a mini project like a fault-tolerant data processing script.
