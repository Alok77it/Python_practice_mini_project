# ğŸ§  Python Comprehensions â€“ Practice Set (20 Questions)

# ğŸ”¹ Part 1: List Comprehensions (1â€“10)

# 1. Create a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.

# 2. Create a list of even numbers from 0 to 20 using list comprehension.

# 3. Convert a list of lowercase strings to uppercase using list comprehension.

# 4. Extract numbers greater than 50 from a list using list comprehension.

# 5. Generate a list of strings like "Item 1", "Item 2", ..., "Item 10" using list comprehension.

# 6. Flatten a 2D list like [[1,2], [3,4]] into [1, 2, 3, 4] using list comprehension.

# 7. From a list of strings, create a list of string lengths using list comprehension.

# 8. Use list comprehension to replace negative numbers in a list with 0.

# 9. Extract vowels from a given string using list comprehension.

# 10. Given a sentence, make a list of words that start with a capital letter using list comprehension.

# ğŸ”¹ Part 2: Dictionary Comprehensions (11â€“16)

# 11. Create a dictionary of numbers and their cubes from 1 to 5 using dict comprehension.

# 12. Invert a dictionary (keys become values and values become keys) using dict comprehension.

# 13. From a dictionary of students and scores, filter out only those who passed (score >= 60).

# 14. Create a dictionary of characters and their ASCII codes from a given string.

# 15. Count the frequency of each word in a list using dict comprehension.

# 16. Merge two lists into a dictionary using dict comprehension (one list for keys, one for values).

# ğŸ”¹ Part 3: Generator Comprehensions (17â€“20)

# 17. Create a generator that yields square of each number from 0 to 9.

# 18. Use a generator comprehension to find the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 under 50.

# 19. Write a generator comprehension that yields only unique characters from a string.

# 20. Create a generator to yield all prime numbers between 2 and 50 using comprehension and filtering logic.

# ğŸ’¡ Bonus Challenge:
# Combine all three types of comprehensions in a single script that:
# - Reads words from a list.
# - Creates a dictionary of word lengths for words > 4 characters.
# - Uses a generator to count only those lengths that are even numbers.
