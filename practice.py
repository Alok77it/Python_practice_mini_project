# ðŸ“˜ Practice Questions: Python Basics
# Topics: Variables, Data Types, Type Conversion, If-Else
# ----------------------------

# ============================
# âœ… 1. Variables
# ============================

# Q1. Create two variables `name` and `age` to store your name and age, then print them.
# Q2. Assign the value of 10 to a variable `x`, then reassign it with the value of 25 and print both values.
# Q3. Create a variable `price` for a product and another variable `quantity`. Calculate and print total cost.
# Q4. Assign the string "Python" to a variable and print its length using the len() function.
# Q5. Swap values of two variables `a` and `b` and print the result.
# Q6. Create variables `x = 5`, `y = 10`, and `z = x + y`. Print all three variables.

# ============================
# âœ… 2. Data Types
# ============================

# Q1. Create a variable for each of the following types: int, float, string, boolean. Print their types using type().
# Q2. Check the data type of user input using input() and type().
# Q3. Create a list of 3 favorite colors and print it.
# Q4. Create a dictionary of your name, age, and city and print each value.
# Q5. Use type casting to convert a float to an integer and print both values.
# Q6. Create a tuple with 3 elements and access the second element.

# ============================
# âœ… 3. Type Conversion
# ============================

# Q1. Convert the string "123" into an integer and add 10 to it.
# Q2. Take user input as a string and convert it to float for a division operation.
# Q3. Convert a boolean value `True` into an integer and print the result.
# Q4. Convert an integer into a string and concatenate it with another string.
# Q5. Convert the float number 7.89 into a string and print its type.
# Q6. Convert a list `[1, 2, 3]` into a string and back into a list.

# ============================
# âœ… 4. If-Else (Basic)
# ============================

# Q1. Take a number from the user and check if it is positive or negative.
# Q2. Ask the user to enter their age and check if they are eligible to vote (18 or older).
# Q3. Check if a number is even or odd.
# Q4. Compare two numbers and print which one is greater.
# Q5. Check if a given number is divisible by 5.
# Q6. Take a number from the user and check if it's between 1 and 100
