# Python Sets Practice Problems (Basic to Intermediate)

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Set and Print It
# Create a set with {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and print it.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Elements to a Set
# Add elements 6 and 7 to the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove an Element from a Set
# Remove 3 from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} using remove() and discard().

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Check if an Element Exists in a Set
# Given {10, 20, 30, 40}, check if 25 and 30 exist in the set.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Length of a Set
# Given {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, find the total number of elements using len().

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Convert a List to a Set (Remove Duplicates)
# Convert [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] into a set to remove duplicates.

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate Over a Set
# Print all elements of {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} using a loop.

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Union of Two Sets
# Given:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# Find the union of set1 and set2.

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Intersection of Two Sets
# Given:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# Find common elements between set1 and set2.

# üîü Find the Difference of Two Sets
# Given:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
# Find elements in set1 that are not in set2.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Symmetric Difference Between Two Sets
# Given:
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
# Find elements that are in either set1 or set2, but not both.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Check if One Set is a Subset of Another
# Check if {2, 3} is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Check if One Set is a Superset of Another
# Check if {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a superset of {3, 4}.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Common Elements Between Two Sets
# Remove elements that are common between {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {3, 4, 6, 7}.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Find Unique Elements in a List Using a Set
# Given the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], find the unique elements using a set.
