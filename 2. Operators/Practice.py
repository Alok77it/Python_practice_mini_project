# Declare your age as an integer variable
# Declare your height as a float variable
# Declare a variable that stores a complex number

# Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle 
# and calculate the area of this triangle (area = 0.5 * b * h).
# Example:
#     Enter base: 20
#     Enter height: 10
#     The area of the triangle is 100

# Write a script that prompts the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle.
# Calculate the perimeter of the triangle (perimeter = a + b + c).
# Example:
#     Enter side a: 5
#     Enter side b: 4
#     Enter side c: 3
#     The perimeter of the triangle is 12

# Get the length and width of a rectangle using input prompts.
# Calculate its area (area = length * width) and perimeter (perimeter = 2 * (length + width)).

# Get the radius of a circle using input prompt.
# Calculate the area (area = pi * r * r) and circumference (c = 2 * pi * r) where pi = 3.14.

# Calculate the slope, x-intercept, and y-intercept of the equation y = 2x - 2.

# Using the slope formula (m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)), 
# find the slope and Euclidean distance between points (2,2) and (6,10).

# Compare the slopes from tasks 8 and 9.

# Calculate the value of y using the equation y = x^2 + 6x + 9.
# Try different x values and determine at what x value y equals 0.

# Find the length of the words 'python' and 'dragon' and make a falsy comparison statement.

# Use the 'and' operator to check if 'on' is found in both 'python' and 'dragon'.

# Check if the word "jargon" is in the sentence: "I hope this course is not full of jargon."

# Check if there is no 'on' in both 'dragon' and 'python'.

# Find the length of the text 'python', convert it to a float, and then convert it to a string.

# Even numbers are divisible by 2 with a remainder of zero.
# Write a Python statement to check if a number is even.

# Check if the floor division of 7 by 3 is equal to the integer-converted value of 2.7.

# Check if the type of '10' is equal to the type of 10.

# Check if int('9.8') is equal to 10.

# Write a script that prompts the user to enter hours and rate per hour.
# Calculate the weekly pay of the person.
# Example:
#     Enter hours: 40
#     Enter rate per hour: 28
#     Your weekly earning is 1120.

# Write a script that prompts the user to enter the number of years they have lived.
# Calculate the number of seconds they have lived, assuming a person can live up to 100 years.
# Example:
#     Enter number of years you have lived: 100
#     You have lived for 3153600000 seconds.

# Write a Python script that displays the following table:
# 1 1 1 1 1
# 2 1 2 4 8
# 3 1 3 9 27
# 4 1 4 16 64
# 5 1 5 25 125
