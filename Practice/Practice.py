# Basic Python

# Print "Hello, World!".
print("Hello, World")

# Take a user's name as input and print "Hello, [name]!".
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Take two numbers as input and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2}")
print(f"Difference: {num1 - num2}")
print(f"Product: {num1 * num2}")
print(f"Quotient: {num1 / num2}")

# Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
num1, num2 = num2, num1
print(f"num1: {num1}, num2: {num2}")

# Check if a given number is even or odd.
num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num1 % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
